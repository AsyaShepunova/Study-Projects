Wikishop online store launches a new service. Now users can edit and supplement product descriptions, as in wiki communities. 
That is, clients offer their edits and comment on the changes of others. 
The store needs a tool that will search for toxic comments and send them for moderation.

In this project, we will train a machine learning model to classify comments into positive and negative. Our goal will be to reach F1 at least 0.75.

Data description
The text column contains the comment text, and toxic is the target.
